# How to create a website! 

Have an HTML document? Want to make the WORLD see it? Follow the steps below! 

## Creating a Github account
If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step. 

First, go to [github.com](https://github.com/)! GitHub is a 
platform for open source projects! 

Pick your username carefully: the username you choose is going to be part of you website domain name! 


Sign up, then go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). 

Name the repository `<username>.github.io`. For example, if your 
username was `Nepaltechguy2`, name the repository 
`nepaltechguy2.github.io`. 

Check `Initialize this repository with README`.

Click `Create Repository`.

#### If you only have one page in your website
Click `Create New File`. 

Name it `index.html`. 

Then, paste your HTML Code in the box. 

Afterward, click `Commit New File` at the bottom. 

#### If you have more than one page in your website
Make sure that one of them is renamed to `index.html`!

Then, click `Upload Files`. 

Lastly, click `Commit New Files` at the bottom. 

### Setting up pages

On GitHub, navigate to your GitHub Pages site's repository.
Under your repository name, click  Settings.

Go down to where it says 


![github-pages](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pages/select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source.png)

Use the Select source drop-down menu to select `master branch` as your source.

Click Save.

Now wait for a couple minutes for it to sync with the GitHub servers! 

You can find your website at the URL `<your username here>.github.io`. 
Just type this in on any computer to have them visit your website!

If you want to ever change your website, just edit the files in GitHub.
If you want a completely custom domain name, like `samyok.us` or something, talk to Samyok. 


*That's it!* If you want to learn more, just google `github pages`! :)
